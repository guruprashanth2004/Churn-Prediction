# Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to predict customer churn using a machine learning model. The code provided performs data analysis, preprocessing, and model building to achieve this goal.

## Project Structure

- `churn_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the project.
- `churn_prediction.csv`: Dataset used for the analysis (replace with your actual dataset file).

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:** Loading the dataset and performing basic exploratory data analysis.
2. **Variable Identification and Typecasting:** Identifying variables and ensuring correct data types.
3. **Univariate Analysis:** Exploring individual variable distributions, outliers, and missing values.
4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis:** Investigating relationships between multiple variables.
5. **Encoding and Missing Value Handling:** Encoding categorical variables and handling missing values.
6. **Model Building:** Building a churn prediction model using logistic regression.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the `churn_prediction.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the code cells to execute the analysis and model building.
